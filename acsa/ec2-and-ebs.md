# EC2 & EBS

## EC2

### Compute Basics

* Computational power required to fulfill your workload
* EC2 launch virtual servers called _instances_
* 2 concepts:
  * the amount of virtual hardware
  * the software loaded on the instance

### Instance Types

* Dimensions:
  * Virtual CPUs(vCPU)
  * Memory
  * Storage
  * Network performance
